## Random Partitioning

TODO Adopting this approach can helps in reparting the data between the partitions more evenly, because any data have the same probability to be in any of the partitions. This also helps to do faster queries, because there will not be large concentration of data in specific partitions.

Homever, it can become harder to introduce queries because the fact the data is randomized. It will require more planning time. This also increase the structural interdependence between the partitions.
