# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

TODO This approach helps increase performance because it allows queries to be made on smaller sets, reducing response time. It also aids in horizontal scalability, making it easier to add new partitions. Additionally, it helps with the management of this data, as it can store large amounts of data more easily.

However, it can introduce a lot of additional complexity, requiring more planning time. It also adds to maintenance costs. A clear problem is the structural interdependence between the partitions and their data.

Homever, it can become harder to introduce queries because the fact the data is randomized. It will require more planning time. This also increase the structural interdependence between the partitions.
